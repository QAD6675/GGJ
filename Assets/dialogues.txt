Hey there, I’m Sophie, the most fabulous feline you'll ever meet! I’m not your regular house cat—I’ve got skills! But don’t worry, I won't claw you… yet. Let's pounce into action, shall we?/Alright, hooman, let’s get those paws... I mean, fingers moving! To walk, press 'A' to go left and 'D' to go right. If you want to show off and jump, press 'Space'. You’ve got this! Or, well, try not to trip over your own feet…/Now here’s the fun part! If you need to squeeze into tight spaces (you know, like how we cats love boxes), press 'S'. Want to stretch and reach the top shelf? Press 'W'. Just be careful not to stretch too much—you might get mistaken for a noodle!/Let’s get that milk, champ! Just don’t let the dogs see you—those furballs don’t know what they’re in for!
