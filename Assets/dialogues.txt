Hello there! I'm Sophie, I'm a cat... DUH! I'm thirsty I want milk, and I need your help. Letâ€™s go./I need to move quickly around here. To walk, I press A-D to go left and right./If I need to jump over something, I just use 'Space'. Simple. Now hurry!/I can grow when i eat fish they are soo delicious/make sure to avoid poisoned ones they reverse the effect/I love playing with yarnballs they're cozy and make me ROLL i wonder if it can launch me to the door/But before i can reach it i need to go through this tiny gap I WONDER HOW!!!(ur the smart one figure it out)
