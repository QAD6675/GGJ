Hello there! I'm Sophie, I'm a cat... duh I'm thirsty I want milk , and I need your help. Let’s go./I need to move quickly around here. To walk, I press 'A' to go left and 'D' to go right. If I need to jump over something, I just use 'Space'. Simple. Now hurry!/Sometimes, I need to squeeze into tight spaces—I love it. It's almost like my body is liquid. I press 'S' to squeeze in. If I need to reach something high, I stretch out by pressing 'W'. I have to be careful though—I can't stretch too much... don't stretch too much.../I'm Serious...
